Enzymes such as laccase contain multicopper active sites that mediate single-electron transfer reactions, generating radical intermediates from phenolic or aromatic moieties commonly present in pharmaceutical contaminants. These radicals subsequently undergo bond cleavage, rearrangement, or oligomerization, leading to structural breakdown and detoxification of the parent compound. For example, laccase effectively degrades diclofenac and carbamazepine via radical-mediated oxidation pathways, achieving up to 95 % removal of diclofenac within hours when immobilized, while simultaneously reducing the toxicity of the resulting transformation products. The catalytic cycle is completed using molecular oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor, producing water as the sole by-product, which allows efficient degradation of trace-level pharmaceuticals without generating harmful secondary pollutants"

These enzymes recognize target molecules through selective binding interactions and promote reactions such as oxidation, hydrolysis, or bond cleavage, converting hazardous compounds into less toxic or more biodegradable products. In aquatic environments, enzyme immobilization on solid supports—such as hydrogels, biochar, or polymer matrices—enhances stability against pH fluctuations, temperature changes, and enzymatic degradation, while maintaining catalytic activity. This approach enables controlled interaction between pollutants and enzymes, making molecular-scale remediation feasible even in dynamic water systems such as rivers."

Enzyme immobilization will be used to enhance catalytic stability, prevent enzyme dilution, and enable reuse, thereby improving applicability in open-water systems. Degradation performance will be assessed by monitoring parent compound removal and transformation product formation, with particular emphasis on toxicity reduction, establishing the feasibility of enzyme-based remediation as a sustainable approach for river systems impacted by pharmaceutical pollution."

          title: "Computationally guided protein stapling for enzyme stabilization",
          content: "Enzymes are the workhorses of biology, and greatly important tools with many applications in biotechnology and medicine. The marginal stability of most natural proteins (-5-15 kcal/mol) presents a major challenge for the exploitation of natural and engineered enzymes in biotechnology and industrial biocatalysis. For example, in biocatalytic processes, e.g., synthesis of drugs, fine chemicals and biofuels, enzymes are subject to harsh operational conditions such as high temperatures and presence of organic co-solvents (e.g., methanol, DMSO etc.); more stable enzymes can withstand these demanding conditions better. More stable enzymes are also more \"evolvable\" i.e., they can better tolerate chemical changes that impart them new or improved functions. Enzyme stabilization represents a crucial, and often obligatory step, for the utilization of their attractive properties. Currently available methods for protein stabilization, such as directed evolution and consensus mutagenesis, can be time- and labor-intensive and often involve extensive amino acid substitutions, which may impair the activity and/or selectivity of the enzyme. Together with Fasan lab at the University of Rochester, we have developed a computational design method (Rosetta-guided protein stapling, R-GPS) for enzyme stabilization that uses structure-based modeling to introduce covalent \"staples\" in a protein scaffold via a genetically encodable noncanonical amino acids. This method was applied to obtain stapled variants of a stereoselective cyclopropanation biocatalyst featuring greatly increased thermostability and robustness to high concentrations of organic cosolvents (Moore et al. PNAS 2017). We are now extending this minimally invasive strategy for protein stabilization to a variety of enzymes and proteins."

Proteases with \"dialed in\" substrate selectivities would be ideal catalytic drugs designed to irreversibly neutralize their target substrates (e.g., viral coat proteins) if their substrate selectivity can be precisely controlled. No robust and general method is available for protease substrate specificity design, in spite of ~25 years of efforts by protein chemists and chemical engineers. Our approach is to develop a mechanism-guided biophysical framework that allows design for both positive and negative substrate specificity, and tightly couple it with high-throughput experimental testing. We have developed a new computational design approach (Rubenstein et al. PLOS Comp. Biol, 2017) combining Rosetta and Amber calculations (Pethe et al. J. Mol. Biol. 2017), and developing high-throughput characterization approaches that combine computational predictions with experimental data obtained using yeast-based screening and deep sequencing (Pethe, Rubenstein et al.

The application we are pursuing is Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy, which is a promising approach to attenuate side-effects and thereby increase the therapeutic efficacy of conventional chemotherapy. In this approach an exogenous enzyme, targeted to the tumor by, for example, an antibody, activates a prodrug to generate toxicity locally. Animal studies and clinical trials have shown that slow clearance leading to activity of enzyme in non-tumor tissue is a major limitation. Computationally designed \"smart\" enzymes, that are constitutively inactive but are activatable by a tumor-specific stimulus (MMP-2 protease) or light (via use of attached azobenzene dyes) are expected to overcome these limitations. We have obtained good starting leads straight from computational design (~10X switches) (Blacklock et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018), developed high-throughput screening approaches (Yachnin & Khare, Prot. Eng. Des. Sel. 2017). Biological characterization of designed enzymes is ongoing (Justin Drake, Rutgers)."
