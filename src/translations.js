      synopsis: "Perovskite photovoltaics, graphene-based interfaces, polymer-perovskite coupling layers, mechanical reinforcement of thin films, lattice dynamics and strain engineering, durable energy conversion materials.",
      summary: "Our research focuses on the materials science of hybrid perovskite solar cells. By integrating graphene-based interfaces with ultrathin polymer coupling layers, we engineer mechanically reinforced perovskite thin films that suppress lattice deformation, regulate strain accumulation, and protect vulnerable grain boundaries under thermal and photoinduced stress. This work aims to advance durable, high-efficiency photovoltaic materials and to provide fundamental insight into the role of mechanical reinforcement in soft ionic semiconductors.",

          title: "Understanding Why Perovskite Solar Cells Fail",
          content: "Perovskite solar cells are highly efficient, but their crystal lattice is mechanically soft and easily deforms under light and heat. During operation, the perovskite lattice expands and contracts, which causes stress to build up at grain boundaries and gradually damages the material. A major part of our research is to understand how this lattice deformation occurs and why it leads to long-term device degradation."

          title: "Reinforcing Perovskite Films with Graphene-Polymer Interfaces",
          content: "To address this problem, we need to introduce a mechanically reinforced interface which is made of single-layer graphene and an ultrathin polymer coupling layer. This structure acts like a protective skin on the perovskite film, restricting lattice expansion and reducing strain during operation. Using techniques such as nanoindentation and tensile testing, we directly measure how this interface improves the stiffness and mechanical strength of the perovskite thin films."

          title: "Linking Structure, Mechanics, and Device Stability",
          content: "We combine in situ characterization methods, including X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, to observe real-time changes in the perovskite lattice under light and temperature. These measurements connect microscopic lattice behavior with macroscopic device performance. By integrating mechanically reinforced films into working solar cells, the study shows that suppressing lattice deformation leads to dramatically improved operational stability under continuous illumination and elevated temperature."
